Introduction

This is the Mantis 3.2.3 release, RC1. 
It includes all updates from the previous release https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis/releases/tag/v3.2.2.

This release required a Genesys block reset in Sagano testnet due to the removal of the treasury opt out flag in block headers.

In V3.2.3, Checkpointing (ECIP-1097) and proto-Treasury (ECIP-1098) are deactivated as they have not reached community consensus yet.

V3.2.2 includes several bug fixes around the synchronization process (fast-sync, regular sync and state download), the ability to capture several performance metrics, initial setup for Keccak-256 mining support, and several other improvements.

For a more detailed description of the functionality and configuration options see the Mantis client home page (https://docs.mantisclient.io/).

Known Issues

* If an RPC request involving the “latest block” is underway at the exact same time a new block is imported, the request may fail. The request can be retried.
