  # Test mode can be one of: single-db, dual-db
  # - single-db: we execute blocks on a read only state (any modifications will be discarded afterwards), and we compare
  #              receipts' root hashes with the state saved in the source DB. Thus this mode requires that the source
  #              snapshot was created without any pruning
  # - dual-db:   we only read blocks from the source DB, and we save all the intermediate state to the target DB, thus
  #              the scope of the test is increased by DB writes and the source snapshot may have been created with
  #              pruning enabled
  test-mode = "dual-db"

  # Path to the DB snapshot that contains all the blocks to be executed (and state for single-db)
  source-db-path = "path/to/source-db"

  # Path to the DB where the state resulting from execution is saved (for single-db this is ignored)
  target-db-path = "path/to/target-db"

  # The initial block number for the test. For dual-db blocks at least until this number must have been executed and
  # save in the target DB. This value can be null in which case for:
  # - single-db: default to 1
  # - dual-db: highest block found in target DB
  start-block = null

  # The last block to be executed marking the test complete. Value can be null - meaning highest block number found
  # in the source DB
